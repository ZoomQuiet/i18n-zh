Release Notes

The Release Notes contain important information for new users and for
an update from the previous version of Debian. It is written in
DocBook XML which allows the creation of various output files in the
formats HTML, text, PDF, ...

To build it you need the package docbook-xsl and (dependent on the
output format and language) dblatex and xmlroff. For PO file based
translations you also need po4a and of course make, ...

Just call "make" to build it. It works also from a language directory
but you need to add the architecture for which you want to create the
document on the commandline, e.g.: "make architecture=i386".

Translations

The document is available in many languages. po4a is currently used as
the translation tool.

To add a new translation, call "make updatepo LINGUA=xx" to create a
new PO template file which you need to translate, with xx being the
language code of your translation.

It is suggested that you now try to create the document for at least
one architecture. This will detect possible syntax errors in your
file.

Send your translation for inclusion to the public mailing list
debian-doc@lists.debian.org.
