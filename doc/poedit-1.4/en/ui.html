<h1>User Interface Overview</h1>

<p>
As you have undoubtably already discovered, Poedit's main window consists
of three parts: there's a list of string-translation pairs in the list in
the upper part of the window, and two text entries under it. The first of the
text entries holds the original string and is not editable, while the second
is where you type your translations. The list is separated from the text fields
with a splitter sash that you can move up and down to adjust how the screen is
split between the list and the input fields.

<p>
There are two UI navigation modes built into Poedit and they differ in
keyboard navigation handling. The first of them (the default) leaves the focus
in the list, while the other redirects it to the text input field. In the first
mode, the list behaves like an ordinary list control and you have to press
Tab to change focus to the text field before you can type in translations, and 
press it once again to bring focus back to the list and move to another 
translation. This is done automatically in the second mode -- its drawback is 
that you can no longer use arrows for list navigation and have to use an alternative
method described below. The 2nd mode is enabled by checking
<i>Always change focus to text input field</i> 
in <a href="settings.html">Preferences</a>.

<p>
When the focus is in the text field, you can use Ctrl-Up/Down arrows and 
Ctrl-PgUp/PgDown keys to move up and down the list
of messages. This works in both modes; it is the only keyboard
navigation that works in the second mode (because the list never gets focus,
you naturally can't use arrows without Ctrl modifier in this mode). This
feature is particularly useful in the first mode where it eliminates the need
to repeatedly press Tab.

<p>
You will see that some items have different color than others in the list.
This is meant to simplify navigation in the catalog -- untranslated strings
are in blue and are always at the beginning of the list.
Fuzzy translations are in yellow (see 
<a href="basics.html">Poedit and Gettext Basics</a> if you don't know what 
fuzzy means). You will notice that `not translated' and `fuzzy' marking is 
changed when editing translation, so you needn't worry about it in most cases.

<p>
Sometimes, there's a small icon to the left of the entry in the list. There are
currently three kinds of icons: a small green dot that indicates you
modified the entry in this editing session, a pencil icon which means 
there's a comment attached to the entry (see <a href="menu.html">menu
description</a>) and finally a gray picture of a computer that is only
shown if you <a href="update.html">updated</a> the catalog and had configured
Poedit to automatically roughly translate new entries (see 
<a href="settings.html">settings</a> and <a href="tm.html">Translation 
Memory</a> section).

<p>
You can right-click on the focused item to display a list of
references (i.e. places in the source code where the given string appears) and 
open the file that contains the given string. This is useful if you are not
sure in what context the string is used. The same functionality is available
via the <a>Edit/Show references</a> menu command. The same popup menu will
display suggested automatic translations if this feature is enabled
(see <a href="tm.html">Translation Memory</a> section).

<p>
See <a href="menu.html">Menu and Toolbar</a> for a description of toolbar icons.
