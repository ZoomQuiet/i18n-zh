<h1>Updating Catalog</h1>

In addition to editing catalogs, Poedit provides convenient way of 
updating catalogs. <b>Updating</b> is process of scanning source files for
translatable strings and merging the changes back into the catalog,
removing entries that are no longer used, adding entries that 
appeared in sources since the last revision of the catalog and 
updating references. External parsers (gettext's <tt>xgettext</tt>) are
used for it, see <a href="settings.html#prefs">Preferences dialog</a>.

<p>
Please note that most sofware projects (such as wxWidgets) provide
its own way of updating catalogs (typically with makefiles), so it
may be undesirable to do in Poedit.

<p>
This feature depends on settings in <a href="settings.html#catalog">
Catalog Settings dialog</a> and is disabled unless you filled-in
"Paths" panel.

<p>
When updating, Poedit will recursively search all specified paths,
looking for known file types and scanning them for translatable strings.
This process may take a while. When done, Poedit will display summary
of new and obsolete strings (unless disabled in Preferences).

<p>
If enabled, Poedit will attempt roughly translate new entries according to
its database of known translations. See <a href="tm.html">Translation Memory</a>
 section for details.
