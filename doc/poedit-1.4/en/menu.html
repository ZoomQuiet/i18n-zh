<h1>Menu and Toolbar</h1>

This section briefly describes all menu entries. If the menu entry has
an equivalent toolbar command, its icon is shown near the item's name.


<h3>File Menu</h3>

<p>
<b>File/Catalogs manager</b>
<br>Opens the <a href="manager.html">catalogs manager</a>.

<p>
<b>File/New catalog...</b>
<br>Creates a new catalog. Note that you will have to immediately save the
file so that Poedit knows the catalog's position in the directory tree relative
to the source code.

<p>
<b>File/Open</b> (shortcut: Ctrl-O)
<br><img src="../common/fileopen.gif">
<br>Opens an existing .po catalog. 

<p>
<b>File/Save</b> (shortcut: Ctrl-S)
<br><img src="../common/filesave.gif">
<br>Saves the catalog. 

<p>
<b>File/Save as...</b>
<br>Saves the catalog under a different name. Note that if you save it in
a different directory <i>and</i> you use Poedit's catalog update feature,
it may stop working, because the relative path to the source files has changed.

<p>
<b>File/Preferences</b>
<br>Edits catalog-independent settings.
See <a href="settings.html#prefs">Preferences dialog</a> for details. 


<h3>Edit Menu</h3>

<p>
<b>Edit/Copy original string to translation field</b> (shortcut: Alt-I)
<br>Inserts the original string into the "translation" text control. This is
useful when the translation is identical to, or very similar to, the original
string.

<p>
<b>Edit/Show references</b> (shortcut: right-click on menu in the list)
<br>Displays a list of all references to the selected string and lets you
view the relevant part of the source file.

<p>
<b>Edit/Find...</b>
<br>Lets you search the catalog for specific words.

<p>
<b>Edit/Translation is fuzzy</b> (shortcut: Alt-U)
<br><img src="../common/fuzzy.gif">
<br>Marks/unmarks the selected translation as fuzzy.

<p>
<b>Edit/Edit comment</b>
<br><img src="../common/comment.gif">
<br>You can edit (or remove) comments related to the selected translation.
This is useful, e.g., when you cooperate with other translators and the translation
chosen requires further explanation. The presence of a comment is indicated by
a pencil icon to the left of the translation line in the list.


<h3>Catalog Menu</h3>

<p>
<b>Catalog/Update catalog</b>
<br><img src="../common/update.gif">
<br>Update the catalog, i.e. synchronize it with the source code.
See <a href="update.html">Updating Catalog</a> for details. 

<p>
<b>Catalog/Settings...</b>
<br>Edits catalog-specific settings.
See <a href="settings.html#catalog">Catalog settings dialog</a> for details. 


<h3>View Menu</h3>

<p>
<b>View/Fullscreen view</b>
<br><img src="../common/fullscreen.gif">
<br>Switches Poedit into fullscreen mode to fully utilize screen real estate.

<p>
<b>View/Display quotes</b>
<br><img src="../common/quotes.gif">
<br>Enables/disables displaying of quotes in text controls. Quotation marks
are useful when you need to see if the text ends or begins with spaces, 
but on the other hand, they may be confusing when the text itself contains
quotes.
