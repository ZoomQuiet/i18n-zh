<h1>Preferences and Catalog Settings</h1>


<a name="prefs"></a>
<h3>Preferences Dialog</h3>

(Available through <b>File/Preferences</b> in the menu.)
<p>

You can set various options that affect Poedit globally and are not 
related to opened catalog in Preferences. There are three tabs in
the dialog box, one for each setting group. 
<p>
<ul>

<li><b>Editor</b><br>

<ul>
<li><b>Identity</b><br>
       Set your name and email address. This is used to fill int
       `Last Translator' record in catalog's header.
<li><b>Behavior</b><br>
 Affects various aspects of Poedit's behavior. <i>Automatically compile .mo file
 on save</i> will cause Poedit to run the <tt>msgfmt</tt> utility to convert
 .po files to .mo ones (which is what you have to done before you can use 
 catalogs in your application). <i>Show summary after catalog update</i>
 enables small window with information about added and removed translations
 after doing update. <i>Open catalogs manager on Poedit startup</i> does 
 exactly what it says - if enabled, Poedit won't start up with its main
 window opened but will launch the manager instead. <i>Always change focus
 to text input field</i> affects keyboard navigation and is discussed
 in the beginning of <a href="ui.html">UI Overview</a> section.

<li><b>CR/LF conversion</b><br>
Lets you choose prefered text file formatting (catalogs will be saved
with this formatting). Among supported formats are Windows/DOC, Mac and
Unix line endings. If you check <i>Don't change format of existing catalogs</i>,
this option will only affect newly created files. It is recommended to use
Unix format, since PO files came from Unix environment.
</ul>

<li><b>Translation Memory</b>
<br>
You can setup <a href="tm.html">translation memory's</a> behavior on this tab. Please
refer to TM section for details.

<li><b>Parsers</b>
    (Warning: for experienced users only!) <br>
    Most importantly, you can 
    edit source code parsers in this dialog. Parsers are used when
    updating catalogs in Poedit (see <a href="update.html">Updating Catalog</a>)
    and they take care of extracting strings from source code. By default
    only C and C++ programming languages are supported (through
    gettext <tt>xgettext</tt> utility). The dialog for editing parsers explains
    in detail how to fill in required information -- if in doubt, refer to
    C/C++ parser which may serve as a complex example of parser definition.

</ul>



<a name="catalog"></a>
<h3>Catalog Settings</h3>

(Available through <b>Catalog/Settings</b> in the menu.)

<p>
This dialog lets you edit catalog specific settings. "Project info"
page contains information from catalog's header and the only really
important information here is the charset. 

<p>
"Paths" and "Keywords" pages are meaningful only if you are going to
use the <a href="update.html">catalog update feature</a>. "Paths" page lets
you specify in what directories should parsers look for source file. Note
that the paths in list box are relative to the base path, so if you set 
basepath to <tt>../../Poedit</tt> and add these two paths into the list box:
<pre>
src
include
</pre>

it will recursively search for source files in following directories:
<pre>
../../Poedit/src
../../Poedit/include
</pre>

The base path is relative to the directory where .po catalog file resists.

<p>
"Keywords" let you specify additional keywords understood by the parser.
See <i>GNU gettext documentation</i> section of the manual for the meaning
of keywords. By default, <tt>xgettext</tt> parser understands <tt>_</tt>,
<tt>gettext</tt> and <tt>gettext_noop</tt> keywords. You may leave this
page empty.

<p>
Note that specifying language or editing anything at "Paths" or "Keywords"
panels will cause Poedit to save .po.poedit file.
