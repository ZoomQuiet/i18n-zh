<h1>Poedit and Gettext Basics</h1>


<h3>gettext</h3>

This introduction is meant for novice users who knows nothing about
GNU gettext. For more details, see <i>GNU gettext 
documentation</i> section of the manual 
(note that it refers to Emacs text editor in many
places so parts of it do not apply to Poedit).

The following summary explains terminology:

<dl>

<dt><b>Catalogs</b></dt>
                <dd>
                Translations are stored in catalogs (files with .po extension).
                A catalog contains header (you can fill header information
                in <a href="settings.html#catalog">settings dialog</a>)
                and translations. Translations consists of two strings:
                original text (usually in English) and matching translation.
                </dd>

<dt><b>.mo files</b></dt>
                <dd>
                .mo file is compiled version of text-based .po catalog.
                Poedit creates it by default (you can disable this in
                <a href="settings.html#prefs">preferences dialog</a>).
                </dd>

<dt><b>References</b></dt>
                <dd>
                Reference is a place in source code where original string
                appears. Sometimes it is neccessary to consult the meaning
                of original text with the source file.
                </dd>

<dt><b>Fuzzy translation</b></dt>
                <dd>
                Fuzzy translation is incomplete, inaccurate translation.
                There are two ways how a translation may become fuzzy:
                either you mark it as such (for example because you are
                unsure about its correctness) or the gettext utility
                <tt>msgmerge</tt> marks it when 
                <a href="update.html">updating the catalog</a>.
                </dd>
</dl>


<h3>Poedit</h3>

Poedit serves as a front-end to gettext. It allows you to edit 
catalog files in comfortable way. 

<p>
In addition to .po file, Poedit saves .po.poedit file with additional
information needed for updating. This file is not created if you did
not edit language, keywords or paths in 
<a href="settings.html#catalog">catalog settings dialog</a>).
