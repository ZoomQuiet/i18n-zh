  <h3><font color="#0000E0">What is the <i>-stable</i> (patch) branch?</font></h3>

  <p>Starting with 2.7, OpenBSD provides a source tree that contains important patches and fixes (i.e. those from the <a href="errata.html">errata</a> plus others which are obvious and simple, but do not deserve an errata entry) and makes it available via <a href="anoncvs.html">CVS</a>, in addition to the <a href="../faq/current.html"><i>-current</i></a> source. Thus, users can choose three options :</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Stick with our latest release and apply the patches by hand.</li>

    <li>Use the <b>patch branch</b> which has those patches and some others applied.</li>

    <li>Use <b>current source</b> for all of the latest features.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>As a general principle, all <a href="errata.html">errata</a> entries will be merged into the patch branch within 48 hours of when an errata is published. Other post release patches may be merged in as well, subject to a number of conditions:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The patches must be simple, short, and obviously 100% correct.</li>

    <li>Errata entries are made for bugs which affect many people. Other patches may be merged into the patch branch if they affect a few people in drastic ways.</li>

    <li>Please do not ask for large subsystems or patches to be merged. Maintaining the patch tree takes a lot of effort which could be better spent on making our next release better.</li>

    <li>New or changed functionality, hardware support or APIs will <i>not</i> be merged. In general, if it requires a man page change, it will NOT be a candidate for the patch branch.</li>

    <li>As an exception to the above rules, OpenSSH release versions will be merged into the patch branch.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>It is worth pointing out the name <i>-stable</i> refers ONLY to the API and operations of OpenBSD not changing, not the overall reliability of the system. In fact, if things go as desired, the <a href="../faq/current.html"><i>-current</i></a> <a href="../faq/faq5.html#Flavors">flavor</a> of OpenBSD, on its way to becoming the next <i>-release</i>, will be an improvement in reliability, security and overall quality over the previous <i>-release</i> and <i>-stable</i>. <a name="getting" id="getting"></a></p>

  <h3><font color="#0000E0">Getting <i>-stable</i> source code</font></h3>

  <p>To obtain the patch branch for a particular release of OpenBSD, you can update on top of a pre-existing source tree (from <a href="ftp.html">FTP</a> or the <a href="orders.html">CD</a>) or you can grab the source tree freshly from an <a href="anoncvs.html">AnonCVS</a> server. Instructions for getting the patch branch and staying up to date are described in the <b>Getting Started</b> section of the <a href="anoncvs.html#starting">AnonCVS documentation</a>. Note that patch branches do not help to upgrade from one release of OpenBSD to another, e.g. to go from 3.9 to 4.0. They only provide a means for staying up to date with the patches within a given release.</p>

  <p>Do not attempt to go from one release to another via source. Instead, please visit the <a href="../faq/upgrade42.html">upgrade guide</a>. Also, you cannot go backwards, from <a href="../faq/current.html"><i>-current</i></a> back to -stable, because of library versioning problems and other changes. <a name="building" id="building"></a></p>

  <h3><font color="#0000E0">Building OpenBSD <i>-stable</i></font></h3>Full details on building from source are provided in <a href="../faq/faq5.html">FAQ 5 - Building the System from Source</a>. This is a simplified summary.

  <p>Once you have obtained a source tree via <a href="anoncvs.html">anoncvs</a>, you must rebuild the system. The stages for doing so are:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Rebuild the kernel</li>

    <li>Reboot with the new kernel</li>

    <li>Rebuild the binaries</li>
  </ul>

  <h4><font color="#0000E0">Rebuilding the kernel</font></h4>

  <p>To rebuild the default kernel from stable:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <pre>
# <strong>cd /usr/src/sys/arch/i386/conf</strong>
# <strong>/usr/sbin/config GENERIC</strong>
# <strong>cd /usr/src/sys/arch/i386/compile/GENERIC</strong>
# <strong>make clean &amp;&amp; make depend &amp;&amp; make</strong>
</pre>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Replace <i>i386</i> with your architecture, e.g. <i>sparc</i>, <i>alpha</i>, etc.</p>

  <h4><font color="#0000E0">Rebooting with the new kernel</font></h4>

  <p>To reboot with the newly compiled kernel:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <pre>
# <strong>cd /usr/src/sys/arch/i386/compile/GENERIC</strong>
# <strong>make install</strong>          <i>(Safely install new kernel)</i>
# <strong>reboot</strong>
</pre>
  </blockquote>

  <p>As above, substitute your architecture for <i>i386</i>. If your system has trouble booting the new kernel, you can easily go back and reboot from the old kernel, now called <i>obsd</i>.</p>

  <h4><font color="#0000E0">Rebuilding the binaries</font></h4>

  <p>To rebuild the system binaries:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <pre>
# <strong>rm -rf /usr/obj/*</strong>
# <strong>cd /usr/src</strong>
# <strong>make obj</strong>
# <strong>cd /usr/src/etc &amp;&amp; env DESTDIR=/ make distrib-dirs</strong>
# <strong>cd /usr/src</strong>
# <strong>make build</strong>
</pre>
  </blockquote>

  <p>This will take awhile...</p>

  <p>If you have a number of machines to keep at <i>-stable</i>, you may wish to make a <a href="../faq/faq5.html#Release">release</a>, creating the standard install <a href="../faq/faq4.html#FilesNeeded">file sets</a>, which can then be quickly and easily installed on any machine of the same <a href="plat.html">platform</a>.</p>
