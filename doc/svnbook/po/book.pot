Compiling a true FAQ sheet requires a sustained, organized effort: over the lifetime of the software, incoming questions must be tracked, responses monitored, and all gathered into a coherent, searchable whole that reflects the collective experience of users in the wild.

Officially, their task was to write a book top-down, starting from a table of contents and an initial draft. But they also had access to a steady stream—indeed, an uncontrollable geyser—of bottom-up source material. Subversion was already in the hands of thousands of early adopters, and those users were giving tons of feedback, not only about Subversion, but about its existing documentation."

msgid "During the entire time they wrote this book, Ben, Mike, and Brian haunted the Subversion mailing lists and chat rooms incessantly, carefully noting the problems users were having in real-life situations. Monitoring such feedback was part of their job descriptions at CollabNet anyway, and it gave them a huge advantage when they set out to document Subversion. The book they produced is grounded firmly in the bedrock of experience, not in the shifting sands of wishful thinking; it combines the best aspects of user manual and FAQ sheet. This duality might not be noticeable on a first reading. Taken in order, front to back, the book is simply a straightforward description of a piece of software. There's the overview, the obligatory guided tour, the chapter on administrative configuration, some advanced topics, and of course a command reference and troubleshooting guide. Only when you come back to it later, seeking the solution to some specific problem, does its authenticity shine out: the telling details that can only result from encounters with the unexpected, the examples honed from genuine use cases, and most of all the sensitivity to the user's needs and the user's point of view."

CVS was open source software itself, and its nonrestrictive modus operandi and support for networked operation allowed dozens of geographically dispersed programmers to share their work.

While the result isn't necessarily the next great evolution in version control design, Subversion <emphasis>is</emphasis> very powerful, very usable, and very flexible.

CollabNet offers a collaboration software suite called CollabNet Enterprise Edition (CEE), of which one component is version control. Although CEE used CVS as its initial version control system, CVS's limitations were obvious from the beginning, and CollabNet knew it would eventually have to find something better. Unfortunately, CVS had become the de facto standard in the open source world largely because there <emphasis>wasn't</emphasis> anything better, at least not under a free license.

Coincidentally, at the time Karl was already discussing a design for a new version control system with his friend Jim Blandy. In 1995, the two had started Cyclic Software, a company providing CVS support contracts, and although they later sold the business, they still used CVS every day at their jobs. Their frustration with CVS had led Jim to think carefully about better ways to manage versioned data, and he'd already come up with not only the name <quote>Subversion,</quote> but also with the basic design of the Subversion data store. When CollabNet called, Karl immediately agreed to work on the project, and Jim got his employer, Red Hat Software, to essentially donate him to the project for an indefinite period of time. CollabNet hired Karl and Ben Collins-Sussman, and detailed design work began in May 2000. With the help of some well-placed prods from Brian Behlendorf and Jason Robbins of CollabNet, and from Greg Stein (at the time an independent developer active in the WebDAV/DeltaV specification process), Subversion quickly attracted a community of active developers. It turned out that many people had encountered the same frustrating experiences with CVS and welcomed the chance to finally do something about it."

After the commit succeeds, many new users would expect the working copy to be entirely at revision 15, but that's not the case! Any number of changes might have happened in the repository between revisions 10 and 15. The client knows nothing of those changes in the repository, since you haven't yet run <command>svn update</command>, and <command>svn commit</command> doesn't pull down new changes. If, on the other hand, <command>svn commit</command> were to automatically download the newest changes, then it would be possible to set the entire working copy to revision 15—but then we'd be breaking the fundamental rule of <quote>push</quote> and <quote>pull</quote> remaining separate actions. Therefore, the only safe thing the Subversion client can do is mark the one file—<filename>foo.html</filename>—as being at revision 15. The rest of the working copy remains at revision 10.

Copying a directory on the server, however, is a constant-time operation, and it's the way most people create branches."

If a program accessing the database crashes for some reason, the database daemon notices the lost connection and cleans up any mess left behind. And because the database daemon is the only process accessing the tables, applications don't need to worry about permission conflicts. These things are not the case with Berkeley DB, however. Subversion (and programs using Subversion libraries) access the database tables directly, which means that a program crash can leave the database in a temporarily inconsistent, inaccessible state. When this happens, an administrator needs to ask Berkeley DB to restore to a checkpoint, which is a bit of an annoyance. Other things can cause a repository to <quote>wedge</quote> besides crashed processes, such as programs conflicting over ownership and permissions on the database files."

And of course, there is a full backup variation of this achieved by omitting the <option>--incremental</option> option to that command. There is some value in these methods, in that the format of your backed-up information is flexible—it's not tied to a particular platform, versioned filesystem type, or release of Subversion or Berkeley DB. But that flexibility comes at a cost, namely that restoring that data can take a long time—longer with each new revision committed to your repository. Also, as is the case with so many of the various backup methods, revision property changes that are made to already backed-up revisions won't get picked up by a nonoverlapping, incremental dump generation. For these reasons, we recommend against relying solely on dump-based backup approaches."

The easiest is by far the full hot backup, which will always result in a perfect working replica of your repository. Should something bad happen to your live repository, you can restore from the backup with a simple recursive directory copy. Unfortunately, if you are maintaining multiple backups of your repository, these full copies will each eat up just as much disk space as your live repository. Incremental backups, by contrast, tend to be quicker to generate and smaller to store. But the restoration process can be a pain, often involving applying multiple incremental backups.

But the only configurable aspect of using those external tools is their location on the system—not the option set, parameter order, etc. Subversion continues throwing all those GNU utility options at your external diff tool regardless of whether or not that program can understand those options. And that's where things get unintuitive for most users."

For the avoidance of doubt, where the\n      Work is a musical composition or sound recording, the\n      synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving\n      image (\"synching\") will be considered a Derivative Work for the\n      purpose of this License.\n\n   c. \"Licensor\" means the individual or entity that offers the Work\n      under the terms of this License.\n\n   d. \"Original Author\" means the individual or entity who created the Work.\n\n   e. \"Work\" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under\n      the terms of this License.\n\n   f. \"You\" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this\n      License who has not previously violated the terms of this\n      License with respect to the Work, or who has received express\n      permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this\n      License despite a previous violation.\n\n2.

The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a\n      Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work\n      apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of\n      this License. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from\n      any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from\n      the Collective Work any reference to such Licensor or the\n      Original Author, as requested. If You create a Derivative Work,\n      upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent\n      practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any reference to\n      such Licensor or the Original Author, as requested.\n\n   b.

Such\n      credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided,\n      however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective\n      Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other\n      comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as\n      prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.\n\n5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\n\nUNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING,\nLICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR\nWARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED,\nSTATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF\nTITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,\nNONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY,\nOR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT\nDISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED\nWARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY\n   APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY\n   LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE\n   OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE\n   WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\n   DAMAGES.\n\n7.

Individuals or entities who have received Derivative\n      Works or Collective Works from You under this License, however,\n      will not have their licenses terminated provided such\n      individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those\n      licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any\n      termination of this License.\n\n   b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted\n      here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright\n      in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the\n      right to release the Work under different license terms or to\n      stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that\n      any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or\n      any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted\n      under the terms of this License), and this License will continue\n      in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.\n\n8.

Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work\n      or a Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a\n      license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the\n      license granted to You under this License.\n\n   b. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a\n      Derivative Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to\n      the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the\n      license granted to You under this License.\n\n   c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable\n      under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or\n      enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License,\n      and without further action by the parties to this agreement,\n      such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary\n      to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n\n   d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and\n      no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in\n      writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver\n      or consent.\n\n   e.
